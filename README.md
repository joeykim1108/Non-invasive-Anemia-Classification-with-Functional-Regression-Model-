# Non-invasive-Anemia-Classification-with-Functional-Regression-Model-
Anemia diagnosis is often invasive. We developed a non-invasive method using smartphone fingernail images from 246 patients. Our functional data regression model treats pixel matrices as functions to preserve image structure, achieving high predictive accuracy with AUC scores of 0.947 (RGB) and 0.952 (HSI).
